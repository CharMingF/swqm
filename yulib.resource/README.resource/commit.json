The book, however, could be used as a basis for a senior undergraduate course. The text is divided into seven major parts. The first two cover Modeling Fundamentals, (including material on mathematics, numerical methods, kinetics, diffusion, etc). The remaining parts deal with major water-quality modeling problems such as dissolved oxygen, eutrophication, and toxics. The text is written in lecture format, ideal for case study and teaching purposes.
